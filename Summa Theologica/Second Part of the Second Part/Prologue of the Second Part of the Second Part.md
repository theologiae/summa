After the general consideration of virtues and vices and of the other things relevant to moral matters, we must next consider each of these things specifically. For general morals are less useful, given that actions involve particulars.
Now there are two ways in which something concerning morals can be thought about specifically:
(a) on the part of the moral matters themselves, as when one considers this particular virtue or that
particular vice; and (b) as regards the specific states that belong to men, as when one considers prelates and those subject to them, or those who are active and those
who are contemplative, or any of the other different states of men. Therefore, we will first give specific
consideration to what is relevant to all the states of men and, second, we will consider
specifically what is relevant to determinate states.
However, as regards the first topic, if we were to treat the virtues, the gifts [of the Holy
Spirit], the vices, and the commandments separately, then we would have to
say the same thing many times. For instance, if someone wanted to give an adequate treatment of the
commandment, ‘You shall not commit adultery’, he would have to inquire into adultery, which is a
certain sin, knowledge about which depends upon knowledge about the opposed virtue. Therefore, our
path of inquiry will be more advantageous and expeditious if we consider a virtue, its corresponding gift,
its opposite vices, and the relevant affirmative and negative commandments all together within the same
treatise. Moreover, this manner of inquiry will be appropriate for the vices themselves in accord with
their proper species. For it was shown above (ST 1-2, q. 72) that vices and
sins are diversified in species by their subject matter or object and
not by the other distinctions among sins—e.g., sins of the heart, of the mouth, and of deed; or sins
stemming from weakness, from ignorance, and from malice; or other distinctions of this sort. By
contrast, it is the same subject matter with respect to which a virtue operates uprightly and the opposed
vices recede from rectitude.
So, then, now that all moral matters have been traced back to a consideration of the virtues, all the
virtues themselves are further traced back to seven virtues, three of which are the theological virtues,
which we will talk about first (questions 1-46), and the other four of which are the cardinal virtues,
which we will talk about after that (questions 47-179).
Now among the intellectual virtues there is, to be sure, prudence, which is contained
within the cardinal virtues and numbered among them. However, as was explained above (ST 1-2, q. 57,
aa. 3-4), crafts, which have to do with things that can be made, are not relevant to morals, which
have to do with things that can be done. And the other three intellectual virtues, viz., wisdom,
understanding, and knowledge, share their names with certain gifts of the Holy Spirit. Hence, they will
be treated within the treatment of the gifts that correspond to the virtues.
Now as is clear from what was said above (ST 1-2, q. 61, a. 3), the other moral virtues are all in
some way or other traced back to the cardinal virtues. Hence, in the treatment of a given cardinal virtue,
all the virtues and opposed vices that are in any way relevant to it will likewise be treated. And in this
way nothing belonging to morals will be left out.

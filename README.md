> As many miracles as articles —[Pope Leo XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Theologica#Reception)

A Markdown edition of the *Summa Theologica* by Saint Thomas Aquinas. Intended for use in individual studies. 

<br>

#  Background
The Summa Theologica, or Summary of Theology, is a compendium of all of the main theological teachings of the Catholic Church, intended to be an instructional guide for theology students, including seminarians and the literate laity. It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. [cf.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Theologica) Please read [St. Thomas's Prologue](./dist/Prologue.md) for his introduction.

# Structure

The _Summa_ has three main divisions called **_Parts_** with a few additions:

- I. First Part: God; creation; angels; and man's nature.

- II. Second Part has two sub-parts:
    - I-II. First part of the Second Part:  man's passions, habits, grace and the law
    - II-II Second part of the Second Part: the virtues of man and his particular morality

- III. Third Part focuses on Christ and the Sacraments.
    - Supplement focuses on Penance and the end of the world

- Appendix I and **Appendix II discuss the subject of purgatory.

Each _Part_ is composed of **_Questions_**:

- First Part has 119 questions
- Second Part has 303 questions total:
    - The First Part of the Second Part (I-II) has 114 Questions
    - The Second Part of the Second Part (II-II) has 189 Questions
- Third Part has 99 questions
- Supplement to Part III has 99 questions (plus 3 in the appendinx)

_Questions_ are addressed in **_Articles,_** that follow a five point outline:

- The topic of the article is given in the form of a question that can be answered *yes* or *no*.
- Plausible responses are listed as **Objections**
- A contrary response (reflecting Thomas’s thinking), usually referencing some authority, is cited (“On the contrary”).
- Thomas argues for his response, “I answer that...".
- Brief replies are given to the initial objections.

# Motivation
I created this repository because I've needed to quote or reference Aquina's thought in my Markdown notes. Before this repo, I could only find HTML, PDF, epubs and plaintext. 

<br>

# Warnings
- This is conversion is unfinished; I will update it and correct as I read more.
	- Expect some inconsistent formatting and missing links abound.
 	- I don't how to read Latin and I am not an expert on the source text.
- I've opted to reduce (what I felt was) unnecessary verbiage in the filenames, e.g. "OF", "THE".
	- Otherwise, refrained from removing content in the files themselves. 
- The text itself may be occasionally inaccurate, due to minor issues in the translated source material. As I read the summa, I will be cross-comparing the online version with David McClamrock's adjustments.
